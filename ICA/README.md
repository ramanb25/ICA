### Context

In [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35533-2_19), I used a metaheuristic — an optimization algorithm — called Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). 
For more information on ICA, check out Esmaeil Atashpaz Gargari’s [webpage](http://www.atashpaz.com/p/ica.html) and the corresponding [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm).
